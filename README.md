# Hybrid AI Stock Price Prediction Web Application

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
Developed a full-stack Flask web app for **5-day stock prediction**.  
Features a unique **ARIMAX-LSTM hybrid ML model** integrating historical data, market breadth, and news sentiment from web scraping.  
Built with **Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas**, and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.  

The app offers an **interactive, dark-themed UI** for dynamic stock search and visual forecasts.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Hybrid Prediction Model**  
  Utilizes a unique ARIMAX-LSTM architecture to capture both statistical trends and complex non-linear relationships in financial data for enhanced prediction accuracy.

- **External Factor Integration**  
  Incorporates real-time market breadth and news sentiment into the prediction model to provide a more holistic forecast.

- **Historical Data & News Acquisition**  
  Fetches historical stock data using `yfinance` and dynamically scrapes news headlines from financial sources (with robust error handling for API changes).

- **Interactive & Aesthetic Frontend**  
  A user-friendly, dark-themed web interface built with **HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS)**, and **JavaScript** for a modern user experience.

- **Dynamic Stock Search & Selection**  
  Allows users to search for stocks/indices and provides a list of matching options for precise selection, similar to professional trading platforms.

- **Visual Forecasts**  
  Generates and displays clear, intuitive plots showing historical price movements alongside the 5-day future predictions.

- **Robust Error Handling**  
  Implements server-side and client-side error handling to provide informative feedback to the user and ensure application stability.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

### Backend (Python Flask Application)
- **Python**: Core programming language  
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the API and serving web pages  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and time-series analysis  
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing  
- **Matplotlib**: Plot generation for historical and predicted prices  
- **Scikit-learn**: Data preprocessing (MinMaxScaler)  
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for LSTM model  
- **Statsmodels**: Statistical modeling for ARIMAX model  
- **yfinance**: Reliable historical market data  
- **yahoo_fin**: (Attempted) News headlines, with fallbacks due to API changes  
- **Requests**: HTTP requests for web scraping  
- **Gunicorn**: Recommended for production as a WSGI HTTP server  

### Frontend (Web Browser)
- **HTML5**: Structure of the web page  
- **CSS3**: Styling  
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Client-side interactivity, async requests (`fetch API`), and dynamic UI updates

# How to Run Locally
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites 
* Python 3.8+

* pip (Python package installer)

* Git

1. Clone the Repository First, clone the project repository from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/Yash961-debug/-Stock-Prediction-Flask-App cd Stock-Prediction-Flask-App

2. Set Up Virtual Environment (Recommended) It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

## Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
## On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

## On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies Install all required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Flask Application Start the Flask development server:
python app.py

You should see output similar to this:

* Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
  
5. Access the Application Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by Flask, usually:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/

You can now use the application to get stock price predictions!

# Deployment Considerations (Future Steps)
For production deployment, consider:

* Disabling Flask debug mode.

* Using a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn.

* Deploying to platforms like Heroku, Render, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or DigitalOcean.

* Optimizing model training (e.g., training models offline and loading them on startup) to improve response times for concurrent users.
